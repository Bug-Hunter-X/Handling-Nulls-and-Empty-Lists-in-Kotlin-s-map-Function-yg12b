This repository contains a simple Kotlin program demonstrating how to safely use the `map` function with potentially null or empty lists. The `map` function is a powerful tool for transforming collections, but it's essential to handle potential null values to avoid runtime exceptions. This example showcases the use of the safe call operator (`?.`) and the elvis operator (`?:`) to achieve robust null handling, preventing `NullPointerExceptions` and providing predictable results even when the input list is null or empty. The code is designed to be clear and easy to understand, with comments explaining each step of the process.
